      summary: `We are direct and decisive. We are risk takers and problem solvers. We are
  more concerned with completing tasks and winning than we are with gaining
  approval from people. Though the internal drive tends to make us insensitive
  to those around us, "D"'s are not afraid to challenge the status quo, and we
  thrive when it comes to developing new things. We need discipline to excel and
  respond to direct confrontation. Our greatest fear is to be taken advantage
  of, and even despite our possible weaknesses which include an aversion to
  routine, a tendency to overstep authority, an argumentative nature, and a
  habit of taking on too much we place a high value on time and use our
  innovative thinking to accomplish difficult tasks and conquer challenges.`,

  Outspoken`,
      summary: `We are curious concluders who place emphasis on the bottom line and work hard
  to reach our goals. We are more determined than we are inspirational, yet our
  high expectations and standards for ourselves and those around us typically
  cause us to make quite an impact, motivating others to follow us. We have an
  array of interests and can become distracted by taking on too many projects.
  We often need to focus, prioritize, and simply slow down. Because we thrive on
  activity and forward motion, we like to accomplish tasks through a large
  number of people.`,

  Outspoken`,
      summary: `We are achievers with an ability to persevere. We are more active than
  passive, but possess a kind of calm sensitivity and steadiness that makes us
  good leaders. We seem to be people-oriented but can easily be dominant and
  decisive when it comes to tasks and project planning. We strive to accomplish
  goals with fierce determination that comes from a strong internal drive, but
  we could benefit from contemplative and conservative thinking as well as
  spending more time focusing on relationships.`,

      summary: `We are challengers that can either be determined students or defiant critics.
  Being in charge is important to us, yet we care little about what others think
  as long as we get the job done. We have a great deal of foresight and examine
  every avenue to find the best solution. We prefer to work alone. Though we
  fear failure and the lack of influence, we are motivated by challenges and can
  often be excellent administrators. We could benefit from learning to relax and
  paying more attention to people.`,

  emotional we tend to be creative problem solvers and excellent encouragers. We
  often have a large number of friends, but we can become more concerned with
  approval and popularity than with getting results. Our greatest fear is
  rejection, but we thrive when it comes to motivating others. Our positive
  sense of humor helps us negotiate conflicts. Though we can be inattentive to
  details and poor listeners, we can be great peacemakers and effective
  teammates when we control our feelings and minimize our urge to entertain and
  be the center of attention. We value lots of human touch and connection.`,

  use our power of influence to attain respect and convince people to follow our
  lead. Sometimes we can be viewed as fidgety and nervous, but it comes from our
  need to be a part of challenges that have variety, freedom, and mobility. We
  could benefit from learning to look before we leap and spending more time
  being studious and still. We make inspiring leaders and know how to get
  results from and through people.`,

  love us. We live to please and serve, and tend to be good listeners. Looking
  good and encouraging others is important to us, as is following through and
  being obedient. We often lack in the area of organization and can be more
  concerned with the people involved than we are with the task at hand. However,
  we can be center stage or behind the scenes with equal effectiveness, and we
  shine when it comes to influencing and helping others.`,

  through the combination of concerned awareness and appreciation of people. We
  excel in determining ways to improve production. We tend to be impatient,
  critical, and can also be overly persuasiveâ€”too consumed by the desire to win.
  We like to work inside the box, and we could benefit from trying new things
  and caring less about what others think. This personality type often possesses
  a gift for teaching; we are generally dependable when it comes to paying
  attention to details and getting the job done.`,

  non-threatening environments. We are often friendly and understanding as well
  as good listeners and loyal workers who are happy doing the same job
  consistently. With an incredible ability to forgive, reliable and dependable.
  S's tend to make the best friends. Our greatest fear, however, is loss of
  security, and our possible weaknesses naturally include not only resistance to
  change, but also difficulty adjusting to it. We can also be too sensitive to
  criticism and unable to establish priorities. In order to avoid being taken
  advantage of, we need to be stronger and learn how to say no. We also like to
  avoid the limelight, but when given an opportunity to genuinely help others,
  we will gladly rise to the occasion. We feel most valued when we have truly
  helped someone.`,

  can often be critical and downright crabby. Verbalizing feelings is difficult
  for us, but when we are not bogged down in details and have clear-cut
  boundaries, we can be big assets to the team by providing calculated reality
  checks. Our biggest fear is criticism, and our need for perfection is often a
  weakness, as is our tendency to give in when in the midst of an argument.
